## Platform Support
The SDK supports the following platforms:

<!-- TODO: Table here? Other Platforms? More details? -->
* Ubuntu 18

## Build Dependencies
To get started developing a Plugin using the SDK, it is necessary to install the development tools and dependencies required for building and running Plugins.

The SDK provides utilities for installing many of the required libraries, however these scripts require super user access and install packages globally, so they should be used with discretion. Before running the `dependencies/install-dependencies.sh` script, review it carefully to ensure that the default installation locations will be acceptable. Otherwise, it is possible to install the dependencies manually.

The SDK requires the following tools and libraries:

```{r prerq-tbl,echo=FALSE}
depData <- data.frame(
  "Name"            = c("gcc/g++"             , "cmake"             , "Boost"),
  "Version"         = c("4.8"                 , "3.15.5"            , "1.70.0"),
  "Reference"       = c("https://gcc.gnu.org/", "https://cmake.org/", "https://www.boost.org/")
)

knitr::kable(depData, col.names = c("Name", "Minimum Version", "Reference"))
```

## RStudio Server Pro
This version of the RStudio Launcher Plugin SDK is compatible with RStudio Server Pro v1.2.1500 or greater. To properly test the integration between a Launcher Plugin and RStudio Server Pro, an RStudio Server Pro license with the launcher feature enabled will be required. To acquire a license please contact sales@rstudio.com.

## Job Scheduling System
Each Plugin is intended to interface with a single job scheduling system. In order to test the Plugin implementation, access to a test environment with the desired job scheduling system will be required.
